# With Me

### Description
A game where you work with AI to complete tasks

### Concept
Using [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), a Rust implementation of the WebGPU API spec, to **create my own graphics engine**, users can interact with a graphical environment.
<br>
Users will collaborate with some kind of AI to accomplish their goal. The AI will learn along with them in the process and 'level up'.
